# Digital-Image-Processing with Python

#Description
  This is a simple exercise i did that processes an image with multiple filters or different transformations.
  Its not perfect but pretty decent. The picture can be any 2D ndarray, preferfably with dtype=uint8.
  Its easy to try building the funtion on your own and then compare the results.

#Dependencies
  python 3.9.13
  numpy 1.21.5
